# Hello! Welcome to my ePortfolio!

My name is Tia Felice and this ePortfolio contains all of the elements of my SNHU Final Project Capstone. These elements highlight all the fundamentals of my Computer Science education at Southern New Hampshire University and 



# Software Engineering Category
The artifact that I enhanced in the software engineering category is a pyramid that was designed and created for my Computer Graphics and Visualization course. I decided to include this artifact because this was a project I was extremely proud of. This course was challenging for me and I had to work much harder in this course than in all my other courses. I felt like this showcased how hard I’m willing to work even if it is something I’m not necessarily good at, not shy away from difficult projects, and how I can continue to improve. 
This artifact was improved by changing the texture and rotation of the pyramid. I did meet the course objectives that I originally planned to meet with this enhancement. The biggest challenge I faced while enhancing this project was having to relearn the computer graphics and how it works and the different variables like float, buffer, shader, etc. I had to relearn a little bit in order to try and pick up back from where I started and create something better. I would not have had to do that if I was in continuous practice with this kind of programing. \n
