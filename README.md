# Hello! Welcome to my ePortfolio!

My name is Tia Felice and this ePortfolio contains all of the elements of my SNHU Final Project Capstone. These elements highlight all the fundamentals of my Computer Science education at Southern New Hampshire University and

This video was created to review my original projects, what they contained, why I chose them to enhance, and what enhancements I planned to make on them.

# Software Engineering Category
[Software Engineering Enhancement](https://github.com/tiaboots/tiaboots.github.io/commit/126926be1f2ce48638db2fdd060cc15f55f831cb)<br />
The artifact that I enhanced in the software engineering category is a pyramid that was designed and created for my Computer Graphics and Visualization course. I decided to include this artifact because this was a project I was extremely proud of. This course was challenging for me and I had to work much harder in this course than in all my other courses. I felt like this showcased how hard I’m willing to work even if it is something I’m not necessarily good at, not shy away from difficult projects, and how I can continue to improve. 
This artifact was improved by changing the texture and rotation of the pyramid. I did meet the course objectives that I originally planned to meet with this enhancement. The biggest challenge I faced while enhancing this project was having to relearn the computer graphics and how it works and the different variables like float, buffer, shader, etc. I had to relearn a little bit in order to try and pick up back from where I started and create something better. I would not have had to do that if I was in continuous practice with this kind of programing.

# Data Structures and Algorithms Category




# Databases Category


- This database is a SQL example because unfortunately I wasn’t able to retrieve the old Codio class assignments I had done a year before. It is a database with my and my family’s basic information like our names, where we are from, and our ages. I created this at the beginning of this class to showcase the “database” enhancement part of my portfolio.
- I created this because I wanted to showcase my favorite class. Learning the basics of SQL was the first time I could see myself using it in “real life” at a job. It got me excited about programming and retrieving databases. I think I formatted this very well and organized it well. I improved this artifact by adding extended family and number of children for all our family members.

- I believe that I met the course objectives with this database enhancement. I found this one to be the easiest one to make enhancements on because I recalled SQL much easier than the software engineering project and the data structures and algorithms portion of the portfolio.

- I learned that I make a lot of silly mistakes and I get “rusty” easily. I do need to put a lot more regular practice into SQL, Java, Python, and other programming languages that I learned while I was at SNHU. It was difficult for me to keep up with me taking 3 classes every 8 weeks and I think a lot of the information that I learned, I dumped a few weeks later and it never really went into my long term memory. The challenge I faced here was learning the basic commands and remembering how to recall a specific data base like “SELECT * FROM ___”.
